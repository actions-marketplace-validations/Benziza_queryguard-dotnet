# Architecture Decision Records

Design records explain each decision, its trade-offs, and when to review it.

## Statuses

- **Proposed**: written, not yet acted on.
- **Accepted**: in force. Code and documentation must match it.
- **Superseded**: replaced by a later ADR, which is linked from the header.

## Adding a record

Open a pull request that adds `NNNN-short-kebab-title.md` using the same headings as an
existing record. A change to a public API, a captured field, the report schema, the
supported framework matrix, or the release pipeline needs an ADR before the implementation.
